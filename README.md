### 1.1 JS Refresher

- [Starting Project](https://codesandbox.io/s/javascript-refresher-start-forked-3587t8).

- [React Project](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-vs-vanilla-demo-forked-h4ftkq).

-  Adding JavaScript To A Page & How React Projects Differ:

   - You can either put your JavaScript code between such script tags, or you can use those script tags to import JavaScript files.

   ```js
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
      <title>TEST</title>
      <script  type="module" src="script.js" defer></script>
    </head>
   ```

   ```js
     <script>
       alert("Hello")
     </script>
   ```

  - The `defer` attribute, to make sure that the script that will be imported, will only be executed after the rest of the HTML document has been read and parsed.
  - The `type="module"` attribute on the script tag makes sure that this JavaScript file is treated as a JavaScript module. And if you are treating your JavaScript files as modules, this unlocks one very important new syntax. The import syntax, where you can import code from script A into script B.
  - We are not use import scripts into React projects.
  - React Projects Use a Build Process: by the React Scripts library. And this is actually a library that's not going to be executed in the browser or that's used by React once it's running in the browser, but instead this React Scripts package provides a bunch of tools that take your code and transform it behind the scenes before it's then injected into the browser.
  - **Why does the code need to be transformed?**

    for two main reasons:
    1.  Because React code uses this special `JSX` feature. It's transformed to something JavaScript knows before the code gets executed in the browser.
    2.  The code you write would not be optimized for production, it would not be minified, for example. `Minification` simply means that, for example, names of variables or functions are shortened to reduce the amount of JavaScript code that's served to the user.

- "import" & "export"
  - Assume that we have two files, File A which contains a variable that used in File B.
  - File A.js Code:
 
    ```js
      const name = "Mai";
      export const age = 28;
      export default name;
    ```
  - File B.js Code:
    ```js
      import username, {age as userAge} from "./A.js";
      alert(`Hello ${username} Your age is ${userAge}`)
    ```
  - There is snother way to import:
    ```js
      import * as user from "./A.js";
      alert(`Hello ${user.default} Your age is ${user.age}`)
    ```
- Revisiting Variables & Values:

  ![Types and Values](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35450622/257054115-63507ef7-7aa6-4056-9f17-716ab395a227.png)
  
  - You use variables because they allow you to reuse a value and because they can help with code readability.
 
  ![Variables](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35450622/257054490-313b658d-1bfd-49fd-bcb0-cdaf87ed9970.png)

  - Define Variables Rules:
    ```js
      let name = "Mai";
      name = "Ahmed";

      const age = 28;
    ```
  ![Rules](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35450622/257054885-e782d71d-b8e8-4844-883e-cb9b02e8239a.png)

- Functions & Parameters
   - simply is that you're defining some code that's not executed immediately, but instead, at some point in the future when you call the function.
   - create a function in JavaScript:
     1. â€ŠDeclaration Function
        ```js
            function sum(a, b) { return a + b; }
        ```
     2. Expression Function
        ```js
            //Can be named:
            (function sum(a, b) { return a + b; });
            
            // Or anonymous (AVOID):
            (function(a, b) { return a + b; });
            
            // Or assigned to a variable
            const sum = function sum(a, b) { return a + b; })

           //Calling
           sum(1+2)
        ```
     3. Arrow Function
    
        ```js
            // Regular:
            (a, b) => { return a + b };
            
            // Single argument, one line return:
            name => name.split(' ')
            
            // Multi arguments, one line return:
            (a, b) => a + b
            
            // Single argument, full body:
            name => { return name.split(' '); }
        ```
    
- Objects & Classes
  - Objects
    ```js
      const user = {
         name: 'Mai',
         age: 28,
         greet(){
          console.log(`Hello ${this.name}`)
         }   
       };
       user.greet();
       console.log(user.name);
    ```
  - Classes is a blueprints for objects
    ```js
    class User {
        constructor(name, age) {
          this.name = name;
          this.age = age;
        }
        greet(){
          console.log(`Hello ${this.name}`)
        }
    }
    const user = new User('Mai', 28)
    user.greet()
    ```
- Arrays & Array Methods
  - Arrays are objects, but they are special kinds of objects.
  - the idea behind an array simply is that you can create a list of values.
    ```js
      const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
      console.log(cars[0])

      const modifiedCars = cars.map(car => car + '!');
      console.log(modifiedCars)
    ```
  - `map()` allows you to transform every item in an array to another item.

- Destructuring
  - Destructuring in Arrays:
  ```js
   let a, b, rest;
   let array = [10, 20]
   [a, b] = array;
   
   console.log(a);
   console.log(array[0])
   // Expected output: 10
   
   console.log(b);
   console.log(array[1])
   // Expected output: 20
   
   [a, b, ...rest] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
   
   console.log(rest);
   // Expected output: Array [30, 40, 50]
  ```
  - Destructuring in Objects:
  ```js
   const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };
   const { a, b } = obj;
   // is equivalent to:
   // const a = obj.a;
   // const b = obj.b;
  ```
  - Destructuring in Function Parameter:
  ```js
   function storeOrder({id, currency}) { // destructuring
     localStorage.setItem('id', id);
     localStorage.setItem('currency', currency);
   }
  ```

- The Spread Operator
  - It pulls out values from an array, and adds them as separate, comma separated values to a new array.
  ```js
   function sum(x, y, z) {
     return x + y + z;
   }
   
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
   
   console.log(sum(...numbers));
  ```
- Control Structures:
  - If/else
  ```js
   function testNum(a) {
     let result;
     if (a > 0) {
       result = 'positive';
     } else {
       result = 'NOT positive';
     }
     return result;
   }
   
   console.log(testNum(-5));
   // Expected output: "NOT positive"
  ```
  - for - loops through a block of code a number of times
  ```js
   for (let i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
     text += cars[i] + "<br>";
   }
  ```
  
  - for/in - loops through the properties of an object
    ```js
      const object = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
      
      for (const property in object) {
        console.log(`${property}: ${object[property]}`);
      }
      
      // Expected output:
      // "a: 1"
      // "b: 2"
      // "c: 3"
    ```
  - for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
    ```js
      const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
      
      for (const element of array1) {
        console.log(element);
      }
      
      // Expected output: "a"
      // Expected output: "b"
      // Expected output: "c"
    ```

### 1.2 React Basics

- What is React?

React is a library for building user interfaces.

- Why would you use it?

To Answer Let's look at Vanilla Js and React Projects:


[Vanilla Js](https://codesandbox.io/s/vanilla-js-demo-6049kj).


[ReactJs](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-vs-vanilla-demo-uc08fv).


So when writing React code, you are writing code in a declarative way.
On the other hand, when writing vanilla JavaScript code, you are writing imperative code, not declarative code.


Declarative approach: it basically means that with React, you will not tell React that a certain HTML element should be created and inserted in a specific place on the user interface as you would be doing it on the user interface as you would be doing it with Vanilla JavaScript.

Imperative approach : is giving clear instructions, clear step-by-step instructions, what JavaScript and the browser should be doing.

- Editing First React App.
  Add a Forth button to [React App](https://codesandbox.io/s/first-react-app-start-7ec9fd) that displays the forth content in the array.

- React embraces a concept called components. React is all about components.
- What exactly is a component?
  React just picks up that concept of functions and of separating code across functions and translates it to the front end web application world where we built an entire user interface by splitting our code into multiple components which we then can mix and match as we need to.

  React Components: are independent and reusable bits of code.

- Creating a new React Project:


  ```$ npx create-next-app```

  Must have node js installed.

- What is JSX?
  JSX stands for JavaScript XML.

  HTML in the end is XML, you could say.

  JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement()  and/or appendChild() methods.

  JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.

  JSX allows us to write HTML directly within the JavaScript code.

  JSX is an extension of the JavaScript language based on ES6, and is translated into regular JavaScript at runtime.

  With JSX:
  
  ```
    const myElement = <h1>I Love JSX!</h1>;

    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
    root.render(myElement); 

  ```

  Without JSX:

  ```
    const myElement = React.createElement('h1', {}, 'I do not use JSX!');
  
    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
    root.render(myElement);
  ```

  What to learn?
   - Adding Basic CSS Styling
   - Outputting Dynamic Data & Working with Expressions in JSX
   - Passing Data via "props".
   - The Concept of "Composition" ("children props")
   - Organizing Component Files
