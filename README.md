### 1.1 React Basics

- What is React?
React is a library for building user interfaces.

- Why would you use it?
To Answer Let's look at Vanilla Js and React Projects:


(Vanilla Js)[https://codesandbox.io/s/vanilla-js-demo-6049kj].


(ReactJs)[https://codesandbox.io/s/react-vs-vanilla-demo-uc08fv].
</br>

So when writing React code, you are writing code in a declarative way.
On the other hand, when writing vanilla JavaScript code, you are writing imperative code, not declarative code.
</br>
Declarative approach: it basically means that with React, you will not tell React that a certain HTML element should be created and inserted in a specific place on the user interface as you would be doing it on the user interface as you would be doing it with Vanilla JavaScript.

- Editing First React App.
  Add a Forth button to (React App)[https://codesandbox.io/s/first-react-app-start-7ec9fd] that displays the forth content in the array.

- React embraces a concept called components. React is all about components.
- What exactly is a component?
  React just picks up that concept of functions and of separating code across functions and translates it to the front end web application world where we built an entire user interface by splitting our code into multiple components which we then can mix and match as we need to.
